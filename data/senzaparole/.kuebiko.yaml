description: "n. a state of exhaustion inspired by an act of senseless violence, which forces you to revise your image of what can happen in this world - mending the fences of your expectations, weeding out invasive truths, cultivating the perennial good that’s buried under the surface - before propping yourself up in the middle of it like an old scarecrow, who’s bursting at the seams but powerless to do anything but stand there and watch."
