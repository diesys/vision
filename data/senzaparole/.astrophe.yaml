description: "n. it's hard not to look at the ground as you walk. To set your sights low, and keep the world spinning, and try to stay grounded wherever you are. But every so often you remember to look up, and imagine the possibilities. Dreaming of what's out there. Before long, you find yourself grounded once again. Grounded in the sense of being homebound. Stuck on the planet Earth."
